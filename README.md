## NumPy Handbook
Collections of frequently used [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) commands. This repository aims to provide quick reference and tutorials for the usage of NumPy. The commands are tested under NumPy 1.12.1 and Python 3.56. Most of the content in this repository is created as the note while I was studying [Python Data Science Handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do). I highly recommend to go through this book if you are interseted in data science for Python.
